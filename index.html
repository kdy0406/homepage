    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Dayeong Kim is a master's student in International Education Policy Analysis at Stanford University. Previously, she was a Country Program Manager at ChildFund Korea and before that she was a Program Manager and a Young Professional at the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA). 
      Driven by her strong commitment to addressing the educational inequity between the Global North and South, Dayeong worked across multiple countries, including Bangladesh, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam. Her projects mainly focused on advancing higher education and TVET and promoting access to education for marginalized girls. At the forefront of Korea's foreign aid, she has consistently sought more impactful solutions for better education at local, national, and international levels. In 2019, she won the Talent Award of Korea for her contribution to international development as an emerging leader.
      Now Dayeong is pursuing graduate studies to realize her professional and academic ambitions: becoming a great academic mind and making a positive change in education in and outside of Korea. Her current areas of interest include international educational development, causal inference in education research, and education in emergencies.</p>
