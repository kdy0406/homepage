    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Dayeong is a Korean aid worker with more than five years of experience in international development and foreign aid.
      Driven by her strong commitment to addressing educational inequities while connecting her home country with others,
      Dayeong has worked across multiple countries, including Bangladesh, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam. Her projects have focused on
      advancing higher education and TVET, promoting girls’ education, and fostering early childhood support.<br><br>
      Previously, she was Country Program Manager at ChildFund Korea and, before that, Program Manager and Young Professional at
      the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA). In 2019, she received the Talent Award of Korea for her contribution to
      international development as an emerging leader. Also, she has studied and researched education in both South Korea and the
      United States, always striving to bring her academic expertise into the field. Pursuing a great scholar-doer, her areas of
      interest include the economics of education, STEM education, and education in low-resource settings.<br><br>
      As an Associate Project Officer at UNESCO, Dayeong is now ready to support Iran’s TVET system towards a more green, digital,
      and inclusive society.
